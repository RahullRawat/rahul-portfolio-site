			<h1>Semantic HTML</h1>

					HTML tags are of two types – semantic tags and non-semantic tags.
					Typically, semantic refers to the meaning of a particular piece of
					code. Semantic elements make your websites much more readable and
					accessible. In HTML5, a semantic tag defines the meaning of the code
					to the developer, user and the browser.
				</p>
				<p class="para-1">
					Elements such as
					<span class="bold">
						header, nav, section, article, aside, and footer </span
					>act more or less like div elements. However where a div tag could
					contain any type of information, it is easy to identify what sort of
					information would go in a semantic header tag.

					<h4>Benefits of Semantic HTML</h4>
					<p>
						<span class="bold"> Readability--</span> The block of code becomes
						easier to read by the use of semantic elements. This is probably the
						first thing you will notice when looking at the first block of code
						using semantic elements. As a programmer you can be reading through
						hundreds or thousands of lines of code. The easier it is to read and
						understand that code, the easier it makes your job.
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="bold">Accessibility--</span> HTML headings like
						<span> header, footer, nav, section, aside </span>etc. allow screen
						readers to easily access content. Before, screen readers had no way
						to determine what a given div was even if you assigned it an ID or
						Class. With new semantic tags screen readers are also able to better
						understand the context and content of your website, meaning a better
						experience for your users.
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="bold">Improve your SEO--</span> Your SEO positioning
						can be affected, positively or negatively depending on the way in
						which the content is written. Semantic HTML allows you to add
						meaning to your markup so that search engines, screen readers and
						web browsers can make sense of it. If you use HTML5 semantics wisely
						you can make your website more accessible, improve user experience,
						and get better search engine rankings as well. Good semantic HTML5
						structure is key for enhancing web accessibility.
